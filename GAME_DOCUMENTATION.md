## Overview

Euchre AI is a sophisticated implementation of the classic Euchre card game featuring:
- **Smart AI opponents** with strategic play
- **Visual suit enforcement** with greyed out illegal cards
- **Comprehensive rule validation** including bower logic
- **Interactive UI** with inline player customization
- **Full test coverage** with automated validation
- **Cross-platform deployment** (Web, Electron, Vercel)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Testing**: Custom test framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Electron desktop apps
- **Development**: Node.js tooling with linting and validation

## Game Rules

### Basic Euchre Rules
- **Players**: 4 players in 2 teams (You & North vs East & West)
- **Cards**: 24-card deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A in all suits)
- **Goal**: First team to **10 points** wins

### Card Hierarchy (Trump Suit)
1. **Right Bower** - Jack of trump suit (highest)
2. **Left Bower** - Jack of same color as trump (second highest)
3. **Trump Ace** through **Trump 9** (descending)
4. **Non-Trump**: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9 (descending)

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Deal**: 5 cards to each player + 1 flipped for trump
2. **Trump Selection**: Players can "order up" the flipped card or pass
3. **Play Tricks**: Must follow suit if possible
4. **Score**: Team that called trump needs 3+ tricks to score

### Scoring System
- **Make It**: 3-4 tricks = 1 point
- **March**: All 5 tricks = 2 points  
- **Euchred**: Fail to get 3 tricks, opponents get 2 points
- **Alone March**: All 5 tricks playing alone = 4 points

### Core Classes

#### `EuchreGame` Main Class
Central game controller handling:
- Game state management
- Player turn logic
- Card dealing and shuffling  
- Trump selection process
- Scoring calculations
- AI decision making
- UI updates and interactions

### Key Methods

#### Card Management
- `createDeck()` - Generates 24-card Euchre deck
- `shuffle()` - Randomizes deck order
- `dealCards()` - Distributes cards in 3+2 or 2+3 pattern
- `displayCards()` - Renders cards with visual states

#### Game Logic  
- `isCardPlayable(card, player)` - Validates legal plays
- `getEffectiveSuit(card)` - Handles bower trump conversion
- `canFollowSuit(hand, suit)` - Checks suit-following ability
- `evaluateTrick()` - Determines trick winner
- `getCardValue(card, trump, leadSuit)` - Card comparison values

#### AI System
- `aiPlay()` - AI card selection logic
- `aiTrumpDecision()` - Strategic trump calling
- Smart suit following with fallback strategies

## API Documentation

### Core Game Methods

#### `playCard(player, cardIndex)`
Attempts to play a card for the specified player.
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} player - Player position ('south', 'north', 'east', 'west')
 * @param {number} cardIndex - Index of card in player's hand
 * @throws {Error} If invalid play attempt
 */
```

#### `selectTrump(suit)`  
Selects trump suit during bidding phase.
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} suit - Trump suit ('‚ô†', '‚ô•', '‚ô¶', '‚ô£')
 * @throws {Error} If invalid trump selection
 */
```

#### `getCardValue(card, trump, leadSuit)`
Returns numeric value for card comparison.
```javascript
/**
 * @param {Object} card - Card object {rank, suit, color}
 * @param {string} trump - Current trump suit
 * @param {string} leadSuit - Suit led in current trick
 * @returns {number} Card value (higher = stronger)
 */
```

### Utility Methods

#### `toTitleCase(str)`
Converts strings to proper title case.
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} str - Input string
 * @returns {string} Title cased string
 */
```

#### `getRandomNPCProfile(player)`
Generates fun character profiles for AI players.
```javascript
/**
